# Google Books highlights and notes extractor
A script to extract highlights and notes from Google Books highlight document in Google Drive.

**Why**. The highlights document is ok to read, but if you want to use the highlights/notes elsewhere, there is no way for you to do this besides manually copying notes one by one.  
My specific use case is adding them to RoamResearch or Anki.

This script is going to extract:
* Highlight
* Note (if present)
* Reference to the position in a book where the highlight originates from.
* Date when the highlight was made. 
* Highlight color

### Immediate Improvement To-do's:
- [x] Simplify regular Markdown output
- [x] Add ability to create "call-out blocks" for Markdown
  - [x] Specify different blocks for different situations (highlight vs note)
  - [x] Custom call-out blocks (according to CSS?)
- [x] Programmatically index the colors


### How to use this:

1. Go to the Google Document created by the Google Books with highlights for the book you're interested in;
1. Download it as HTML;
1. Uncompress the archive that you got on the previous step;
1. Install dependencies if any are missing (see requirements.txt)
1. Run parser.py with the HTML file you got after unpacking the archive as an input. E.g: 
    * Markdown `python export_books.py local /path/to/file.html -o output.md -b "Book name" --since yesterday`
    * Roam Graph `python export_books.py roam /path/to/file.html -b "Book name" --since yesterday --graph stvad-api --api-key <key> --graph-token <token>` 


#### Output formats

This script supports the following output formats:

1. **Markdown** - store output to local Markdown file. Formatted to be pasted in Roam
1. **CSV** - store output to local CSV file. Structured in a way that it's easy to import into Anki
1. **Roam Graph** - this method uses Roam API to add highlights directly to the book's page in your Roam Graph (You'd need API token to use this)
